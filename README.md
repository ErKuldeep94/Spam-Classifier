# Spam-Classifier
In this project, Using the support vector machines (SVMs)  a spam classiﬁer is built.

In the ﬁrst half of this project, you will be using support vector machines (SVMs) with various example 2D datasets. Experimenting with these datasets will help you gain an intuition of how SVMs work and how to use a Gaussian kernel with SVMs.The main file to run the first half is ProjectFinal.m 

In the next half of the project, you will be using support vector machines to build a spam classiﬁer.
The main file to run the second half is Project_spam.m
